## The idea, in plain terms

**For newcomers:** You're moving to Miami — maybe from NYC — and need the **right neighborhood** and **living setup** (e.g. your own apartment with a **co-leaser** on the lease in Wynwood, Downtown, or Brickell — not a co-living facility).

**Illustrative business case:** A residential operator *could* use a **recommendation engine + LLM** to improve lease-up and retention. That scenario motivates the eval metrics — it is **not** a Flow-assigned product roadmap.

This project builds that engine: match users to **3–5 neighborhoods** from budget, household, housing preference, and lifestyle — with an MCP-backed LLM that explains results without inventing listings.

## Example user stories

| Who | What they want | Illustrative operator impact |
|-----|----------------|------------------------------|
| **Couple from NYC** | Own apartment with a co-leaser | Faster lease decision → **occupancy** |
| **Solo mover** | Own studio/1BR, no roommates | Better initial fit → **renewal** likelihood |
| **Solo, wants community** | Co-living (optional path) | Fill appropriate inventory → **occupancy** |

---

## What you'll build

| Step | What happens |
|------|----------------|
| 1 | User enters budget, alone vs. with co-leaser, own apartment vs. co-living, and lifestyle priorities |
| 2 | Recommender ranks ZIP codes — prioritizing **own apartment** matches for couples and solo movers |
| 3 | NLP surfaces review themes (transit, social, co_living, etc.) |
| 4 | MCP server + agent answer only from tool outputs |

### Anchor neighborhoods (own apartment)

| Area | ZIP | Why newcomers like it |
|------|-----|------------------------|
| **Wynwood** | 33127 | Creative, walkable, social — good for couples who want energy |
| **Downtown Miami** | 33128 | Central, Metromover, easy commute |
| **Brickell** | 33130 | Towers, Metrorail, restaurants, young professional vibe |
