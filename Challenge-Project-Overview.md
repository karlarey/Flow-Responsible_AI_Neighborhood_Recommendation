## 🏢 About Flow

Flow is a residential operator where **occupancy** and **renewals (retention)** drive portfolio performance. When units lease faster and residents stay longer, Flow's operational metrics improve — and that strengthens the company's position with **PE investors and lenders**.

### Why Flow would use this

| Business goal | What goes wrong today | How this project helps |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Occupancy** | Prospects churn during a slow, confusing housing search | Personalize **3–5 neighborhood matches** faster → better fit → **lease signed sooner** |
| **Renewals / retention** | Bad initial match → unhappy residents → move out at renewal | Match newcomers to the **right area and living setup** upfront → higher satisfaction → **residents stay** |
| **Investor & lender confidence** | Hard to show differentiated, data-driven leasing | Responsible AI rec engine + LLM → measurable match quality → **stronger ops story** for capital partners |

**End users** are newcomers (e.g. a couple moving from NYC who want their own apartment in Wynwood, Downtown, or Brickell — not co-living). **Flow** deploys the engine to improve lease-up and retention. **PE and lenders** don't use the app — they evaluate Flow on occupancy, renewal rates, and how well the portfolio is run.

### What you're building for Flow

A **recommendation / personalization engine** connected to an **LLM via MCP**:

```text
Prospect preferences → Rec engine (rank ZIPs) → MCP tools → LLM (explain results)
                              ↓
                    Better match → occupancy ↑, renewals ↑
```

**What we won't do:** steer people by race or family status, score individual tenants, or show fake listings as if they're real.

## 🎯 The Challenge

### The problem

For newcomers, housing search in Miami is overwhelming — listings are scattered and AI tools often invent facts. For **Flow**, every slow or mismatched search risks **lost leases (occupancy)** and **early move-outs (retention)**. Your job is to build a **grounded personalization engine** that helps prospects find the right fit faster — and gives Flow a responsible AI story that supports relationships with **investors and lenders**.

### What you'll build

A **neighborhood recommender for Miami newcomers**.

**Primary use case:**  
*"I'm moving from NYC with my partner. We want our own apartment — no co-living — in Wynwood, Downtown, or Brickell."*

| Input | Options | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Household** | Alone or with partner | With partner |
| **Housing preference** | **Own apartment** or **co-living** | Own apartment |
| **Budget + lifestyle** | Rent max, transit, social, quiet, etc. | $2,500, transit + walkable |

| Preference | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| **Own apartment** | Private lease — studio, 1BR, or 2BR. **No roommates.** For you alone or you + partner. |
| **Co-living** | Optional — only if user is **alone** and **wants** shared housing / roommates |

> User chooses household and preference. Never infer relationship status from demographics.

**Anchor neighborhoods (own apartment):**

| Neighborhood | ZIP |
|--------------|-----|
| **Wynwood** | 33127 |
| **Downtown Miami** | 33128 |
| **Brickell** | 33130 |

Your full system will:

1. Take **budget**, **household**, **housing preference**, and **lifestyle tags**
2. Recommend **3–5 ZIP codes** via ML similarity
3. Surface **review themes** from crowd text
4. Connect an **MCP-backed agent** (tool-grounded answers only)
5. **Label synthetic demos** and refuse harmful requests

### How we'll know it's working

Measure **three layers** — see [EVAL_FRAMEWORK.md](EVAL_FRAMEWORK.md) and starter tests in [`eval/`](eval/).

| Layer | Metric | Plain English |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| **1. Rec engine** | Precision@3 / @5 | Top ZIPs match advisor gold labels |
| **1. Rec engine** | Mean cosine similarity | Recommendations fit stated preferences |
| **2. MCP routing** | Tool selection accuracy | Agent calls `recommend` vs `area_stats` vs `ethics` correctly |
| **3. LLM** | Tool grounding rate | Answers cite tool JSON only — no invented facts |
| **3. LLM** | Refusal rate | Prohibited prompts refused ([eval/prohibited_prompts.json](eval/prohibited_prompts.json)) |
| **NLP** | Theme coverage | Recommended ZIPs have relevant review themes |

### Use metrics to improve — not just to report

Don't wait until November to check these. Use them like a GPS:

| When | What to do | If results are weak… |
|------|------------|----------------------|
| **September** | Build a simple baseline recommender | — |
| **Early October** | Swap in stronger public data (Census, Zillow indices) | Recommendations feel random → upgrade features |
| **Mid October** | Tune weights, filters, similarity approach | Top picks all look the same → adjust model |
| **Late October** | Add NLP themes + MCP tools + agent | Agent makes up stats → enforce tool-only answers |
| **November** | Test edge cases and fair-housing refusals | Agent says yes to bad requests → tighten ethics layer |
| **End of semester** | Compare baseline vs. final; write it up in README | — |

### Monthly milestones

| Month | Focus | Your main tasks |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **September** | Understand the data | Explore CSVs, note what's real vs. demo, handle missing values, get a baseline score |
| **October** | Build and improve the model | Better public data, recommender tuning, NLP themes, **MCP server** |
| **November** | Evaluate and present | Run full [eval/](eval/) scorecard; presentation + README |

> **Tip:** Create a GitHub Projects board in this repo. Add columns for September, October, and November. Break big tasks into weekly to-dos.

## 📊 Dataset

**Source:** Public Miami-Dade snapshots (Census, migration, rent indices) + starter demo files  
**Format:** CSV  
**Size:** Under 1 GB — easy to work with in Colab or locally  
**Where:** [`data/`](data) folder in this repo

### Real data vs. demo data — why both?

| File | Real or demo? | Why it's here |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| `miami_dade_public_features.csv` | **Real** | Actual public stats by ZIP — rent, population, migration |
| `miami_dade_zctas.txt` | **Real** | List of Miami-Dade ZIP codes |
| `area_features.csv` | **Mixed starter** | ZIP scores + `co_living_friendly`; anchor rows for **Wynwood (33127), Downtown (33128), Brickell (33130)** |
| `crowd_text_snippets.csv` | **Demo** | Review themes including transit, social, co_living |
| `area_options.csv` | **Synthetic only** | `housing_preference` (`own_apartment` / `co_living`), `household` (`alone` / `with_partner`) — **NOT REAL LISTINGS** |

**The plan:** Start with this mix so you can build fast. Over the semester, replace demo pieces with stronger public sources. The recommender should lean more on real data as you go.

### Good to know

- Everything is **snapshots** — not live Zillow feeds or scraped listings
- Some Census values show as `-666666666` when data is missing; decide how to handle that in cleaning
- Any UI showing `area_options.csv` must say clearly that cards are demos
- Column details: [`data_dictionary.md`](data_dictionary.md)

### Data upgrades for October

- [Census API](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html) — fresher ACS pulls
- [Zillow Research data](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) — rent and home-value indices
- [Kaggle apartment reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahis/apartment-reviews-on-googlemaps) — real review text filtered for Miami/FL

## 🛠️ Suggested tools

| Tool | What you'll use it for |
|------|------------------------|
| **Python** | Everything |
| **pandas + scikit-learn** | Data prep and similarity-based recommendations |
| **NLP** | Pulling themes from review text |
| **Streamlit** | Simple demo app for users |
| **Gemini + MCP** | AI agent that calls your tools (Gemini key optional) |
| **Docker** | Optional — for reproducible deployment |

## 🔌 MCP server — what it is and why you need it

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a standard way for an AI agent to call your code — like giving it a fixed set of reliable functions instead of letting it guess.

Your team will build an MCP server with **five tools**:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `schema` | "Here are the columns in our dataset." |
| `area_stats` | "Here are the stats for this ZIP (or all ZIPs)." |
| `crowd_themes` | "Here's what people say about transit, quiet, etc. in this ZIP." |
| `recommend` | "Given budget, household, housing preference, and lifestyle tags — top neighborhoods." |
| `ethics` | "Here's what this tool is allowed and not allowed to do." |

**Why it matters:** If the agent can only speak through these tools, it's much harder for it to invent a $1,200 Brickell apartment that doesn't exist. That's your **tool grounding rate**.

## 🛡️ Responsible AI — non-negotiables

- **Neighborhoods, not people** — recommend areas, never score tenants or applicants
- **User picks preferences** — no steering by race, ethnicity, or family status
- **Label fake listings** — `area_options.csv` is for demos only
- **No live scraping** — use public snapshots, not real-time rental site crawlers
- **Say no when you should** — refuse tenant scoring, demographic filtering, or anything that breaks fair housing spirit
